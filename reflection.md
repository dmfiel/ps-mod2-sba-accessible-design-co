Reflection Questions

1. What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?

The hardest challenge adding accessibility to the site was to remember to make all the required changes. Thankfully, with good lessions, instructions, and copious notes; this wasn't too difficult. Actually changing the colors, adding the labels and roles wasn't bad.

2. How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?

I made it so all elements either resized or flowed properly depending on screen width. I also made it so all images and text had good contrast. I made sure all hover CSS had matching focus attributes and that buttons and fields were accessible by keyboard. With these changes, most users should be able to use the site easily.

3. What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?

The WebAIM contrast checker was useful to make sure text was readable. Flexbox Froggy was pretty fun and helped me to understand the available options much better than I had before. W3Schools and Stack Overflow were very helpful to get the CSS working correctly, especially for the auto-sizing hero background.
