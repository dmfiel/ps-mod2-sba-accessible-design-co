Accessible Design Co. Home Page

This project is a responsive, multi-section webpage for a fictitious company called Accessible Design Co.. It include many feature such as:

1. Semantic HTML elements to create a clear and meaningful structure
2. A responsive navigation bar that adjusts to smaller screen sizes
3. A multi-column layout collapses to a single column on mobile devices.
4. Extensive use of ARIA roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of interactive elements
5. All images have meaningful alt text
6. Proper keyboard navigation and focus management for all interactive elements
7. Text with sufficient contrast for enhanced readability

The code is quite compact with just a couple files plus a folder of images, so it should be easily viewable on most browsers.
